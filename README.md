# Philosophers

## Project description
This project recreates the ancient myth of philosophers dining. 
It involves a program that uses threads to represent each philosopher, with each engaging in the routine of eating, sleeping, and thinking. 
If a philosopher goes a specified time without eating, they "die," and the program must terminate. 

The bonus part of the project involves the same scenario but using forks and semaphores.
